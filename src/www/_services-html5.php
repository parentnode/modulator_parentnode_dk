			<h1>HTML/HTML5</h1>
			<p>
				The foundation of the Internet is the HyperText Markup Language, <a href="http://wikipedia.com/HTML">HTML</a>.
				The latest version HTML5 has been praised and scolded like few others with and without good reason.
				The truth is, HTML5 in itself is just a markup language with a few additional semantic markup tags. In
				most cases when anyone talks of HTML5, what they really mean is the very powerful combination of
				HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have more than 13 years of individual HTML experience, and will calmly take on any HTML challenge
				put in front of us.
