			<h1>We interface, therefore we are!</h1>
			<p>
				In so many ways connections are the 
				basis of our society and our human interfaces (mouth, eyes, ears, hands, skin, 6th. sense, etc.) allow
				us to establish new connections, have new inputs, voice our opinions to others using broadly accepted
				standards of communication.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you may have noticed, connections, interfaces and not least standards are also vital in regards to the internet. We do
				our utmost to respect this nature of our benefactor, and we insist on building systems under these terms.
				This is obviously reflected in the systems, tools and frameworks we prefer to work with, as well as in our
				own solutions. At the end of the day this is cheaper and better for everyone, though it does require some
				initial thinking ahead. Fortunately we have been thinking ahead for a while.
			</p>
			<!--p>
				This approach now allows us to offer a set of APIs designed to be 100% standardized.
