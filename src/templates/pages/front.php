		Modulator is a SEO optimized markup model for HTML, that allows you to build any kind of site or app, 
		for any kind of device. It is fully W3C- and AAA-compliant, lightweight and as flexible as you will ever need. 
		This markup model is per default supported by all HTML capable browsers - finally there is a way
		to spread your message across the planet, regardless of enduser device. That includes the more than 6.000.000.000
		mobilephones. The only question left is: What do you want to say?
	</p>
	<p>
		Modulator is a set of bestpractices deductected from more than a decade of working professionally with HTML,
		always striving towards a complete separation of content, design and functionality and full accessibility
		for both the living and the binary.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is really easy to implement and works with any modern CMS. Ironically in it's attempt to prioritize frontend
		development it ended up making backend implementation easier than ever.
		You can reuse any snippet of HTML across websites with different designs and easily implement you current 
		design and markup in a new CMS. Or you can skin your content diffently for different consumers and devices. One 
		markup, multiple presentations. It really IS that simple.
